1989 - NBA expanded to 25, making 9 potential lottery teams
1990- NBA expanded to 27, making 11 potential lottery teams. The weighted lottery was introduced, which gave teams with worst records better odds on getting a lottery pick.

Conclusions from regression data

1. Change in winning percentage is statistically coorelated with lottery luck. Playoff success is not.
2. The biggest outlier is the Golden State Warriors 1995 draft lottery in which they were ranked 5th pre draft and ended up with the first pick. Even though the lottery luck was high that year, they ended up with around the same record the following 8 years.
3. The relationship between playoff success and lottery luck does not have normally distributed errors, indicating that it is not a liner relationship.
