Every NBA Draft lottery result, along with expected values, and analysis on results.

Explanation on NBA draft Lottery

The weighted NBA draft lottery is determined by drawing 4 balls out of 14 that are numbered 1-14. This creates 1001 combinations. 1000 of these combinations are given out to each team that does not make the playoffs based off of record. The exact number of combinations changes almost every year.

With this project I had the goal of determing three things:
1. Which teams have had the most draft lottery luck historically
2. How much has draft lottery luck affected future regular season winning percentage
3. How much has draft lottery luck affected future playoff success



NBA Draft Lottery History

1985 - Lottery started, the 7 non-playoff teams were chosen in random order.

1987- Only the first three picks were chosen by lottery, the remainder of the picks were determined by reverse standing. 

1989 - NBA expanded to 25, making 9 potential lottery teams

1990- NBA expanded to 27, making 11 potential lottery teams. The weighted lottery was introduced, which gave teams with worst records better odds on getting a lottery pick.

1995- NBA expanded to 29, making 13 potential lottery teams. The Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors were given the sixth and seventh pick.

1996 - 1998 - The Grizzlies and Raptors participated in the lottery but were ineligible for the first pick. 

2004 - NBA expanded to 30, adding the Charlote Bobcats, making 14 potential lottery teams. The Charlotte Bobcats didn't participate in lottery and were given the fourth pick and they were elgible for the first pick the next year.

2019- The lottery format changed to have 4 lottery picks instead of three. Odds were flattened as to prevent organizations from tanking.

1995 and 2004 - The VAN and TOR picks in 1995 and CHA pick in 2004 were ignored since picks were given and not determined by lottery. 

Notes on Teams changing names

BKN - represents the nets, Brooklyn or New Jersey

MEM/VAN - represents the Grizzlies, Vancouver or Memphis

OKC/SEA - represents the Thunder/Supersonics

NOP/CHA - Represents the Charlotte Hornets (from 1988 to 2002) and New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets.

CHA - represents the Charlotte Bobcats and Charlotte Hornets (2015 - present). 



Answers to original questions

1. The San Antonio Spurs have had the most luck on average and the Dallas Mavericks have had the lowest amount of luck
2. There is a statistically significant positive relationship between draft lottery luck and regular season winning percentage at a 99.143 confidence level
3. There is a positive relationship between lottery luck and playoff success, however it is not statistically significant.


Additional conclusions

1. The biggest outlier is the Golden State Warriors 1995 draft lottery in which they were ranked 5th pre draft and ended up with the first pick. Even though the lottery luck was high that year, they ended up with around the same record the following 8 years.
2. The relationship between playoff success and lottery luck does not have normally distributed errors, indicating that it is not a liner relationship.
